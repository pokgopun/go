HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #167 and I got the opportunity to propose the
   challenge.

   For me the main attraction was the [24]blog post by Julien Fiegehenn
   for the first time.

   Colin Crain seems to be busy as we didn’t get the blog post 2 weeks in
   a row. However, Ryan Thompson is filling up the space for now. I am so
   greatful to all those who blog about their solutions. I know how much
   effort it takes to get one out.

   Sadly, I haven’t participated in the weekly challenge for 2 weeks in a
   row. What a shame !!! I aim to do at least one task, even that didn’t
   happen. I am hoping to get back on track this week. Please wish me
   luck. I am going through low phase right now, so just taking it easy.
   My TODO list keeps growing and not much happening unfortunately. I
   avoid looking at my own TODO list as it is embarassing. I pretend never
   seen it. Not sure how long it would carry on like this. I stopped
   adding any new items to the TODO list.

   I would like to thank James Smith for his contributions. I would highly
   recommend you do checkout his work as he always goes beyond what is
   needed. It takes a lot of time to get to that. He has been doing this
   for weeks now.

   Similary for guest contributions, Roger Bell_West, is leading the pack.
   I used to contribute in Swift, Python and Java but not anymore. So I
   can relate how much time and energy it takes to do all of these week
   after week.

   PokGoPun is on the loose apparently as he is not doing solving the
   current weekly challenge in Go but also the past weekly challenges. He
   (I am assuming) is already gone past me in the guest leader board. Well
   done.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Circular Prime

Submitted by: [41]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find out first 10 circular primes having at least 3
   digits (base 10).

   Please checkout [42]wikipedia for more information.

     A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number
     generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its
     (base 10) digits will also be prime.

Output

113, 197, 199, 337, 1193, 3779, 11939, 19937, 193939, 199933

Task 2: Gamma Function

Submitted by: [43]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Implement subroutine gamma() using the [44]Lanczos approximation
   method.

[2022-05-31]

   Ryan Thompson wrote an interesting blog explaining the subject in
   details. Highly recommended if you are looking for more information.

Example

print gamma(3); # 1.99
print gamma(5); # 24
print gamma(7); # 719.99
