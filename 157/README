HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome Kueppo Wesley to the Team PWC. Thank you for the impressive
   introduction as below.
My name is KUEPPO Wesley and I live in Africa/Cameroon/Yaounde, I'm 20 yrs/old,
the first born out of 7.

I'm a student at the University of Yaounde I, level 3, preparing for my Bachelor
's degree in Computer Science. I started Computer Science in 2019, back then I n
ever really knew what it was, I only mastered C, sh, and Awk. I barely scratched
 the surface of Python, Javascript and C++, I learnt them just for school stuffs
 and I fell in love with Perl and Raku some months ago.

My chosen fields are Operating systems and Computer Networks.

I'm living in anguish, the reason why I'm so slow but by the end of this academi
c year, I have as objective to master the development of web back-end systems (i
n Perl and Javascript) and DevOps so that at the end I might be able to get a jo
b from Perl jobs.

My parents are planning to move me to Belgium so I can have more opportunities a
nd support them.

Perl Projects I'm currently working on are

    1. Paranoid, an ncurses based system resource monitoring tool.
    2. Krit, a HEAD/GET/POST/PUT/DELETE web server.
    3. My blog (with Mojo).

Perl, Raku and AWK are my programming languages of interest in solving the weekl
y challenge but apart from that I'm also fully interested in Posix sh, C, Rust,
Lua, Javascript, and Typescript.

   Kueppo Wesley first contributions in [24]Perl is impressive. Not only
   that but we also got 2 blog posts one each for [25]Task #1 and [26]Task
   #2. I am looking forward to Colin's verdict when he gets to review his
   contributions.

   After a gap of 2 weeks, I finally got the time to contribute in
   [27]Perl and [28]Raku.

   Thanks [29]Duncan C. White for the encouraging words. It means a world
   to me.
I liked the first task a lot, struggled slightly with the second just because I
was a bit tired. Overall took 1h30m or so.

   Thank you, W. Luis Mochan, for the fun one-liner in Raku for the task
   Pernicious Numbers.
raku -e 'say (1..Inf).grep({is-prime([+] split "", sprintf "%b", $_)})[^10]'

   I would like to thank PokGoPun for regularly contributing in [30]Go. It
   gives me immense pleasure to see members contributing in guest
   languages too. We had 10 contributors sharing solutions in guest
   languages last week.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Pythagorean Means

Submitted by: [48]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a set of integers.

   Write a script to compute all three Pythagorean Means i.e Arithmetic
   Mean, Geometric Mean and Harmonic Mean of the given set of integers.
   Please refer to wikipedia [49]page for more informations.

Example 1:

Input: @n = (1,3,5,6,9)
Output: AM = 4.8, GM = 3.8, HM = 2.8

CORRECTION [2022-03-21 16:35] GM = 3.9 (before)

Example 2:

Input: @n = (2,4,6,8,10)
Output: AM = 6.0, GM = 5.2, HM = 4.4

Example 3:

Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
Output: AM = 3.0, GM = 2.6, HM = 2.2

TASK #2 › Brazilian Number

Submitted by: [50]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a number $n > 3.

   Write a script to find out if the given number is a Brazilian Number.

     A positive integer number N has at least one natural number B where
     1 < B < N-1 where the representation of N in base B has same digits.

Example 1:

Input: $n = 7
Output: 1

Since 7 in base 2 is 111.

Example 2:

Input: $n = 6
Output: 0

Since 6 in base 2 is 110,
      6 in base 3 is 20 and
      6 in base 4 is 12.

Example 3:

Input: $n = 8
Output: 1

Since 8 in base 3 is 22.
