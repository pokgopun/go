   We are celebrating Idd today in England. Happy Idd to all the members
   of Team PWC.

   Today is also the first Monday of the month, Time to declare the next
   champion. With great pleasure, we declare Matthew Neleigh as our next
   champion. He is currently ranked #50 in the leader board with 37
   contributions in Perl and total score of 74.

   We got back to back contributions by Ryan Thompson and Julien
   Fiegehenn. Thank you.

   Lets keep the momentum going together.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesnâ€™t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Sum Bitwise Operator

Submitted by: [40]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given list positive numbers, @n.

   Write script to calculate the sum of bitwise & operator for all unique
   pairs.

Example 1

Input: @n = (1, 2, 3)
Output: 3

Since (1 & 2) + (2 & 3) + (1 & 3) => 0 + 2 + 1 =>  3.

Example 2

Input: @n = (2, 3, 4)
Output: 2

Since (2 & 3) + (2 & 4) + (3 & 4) => 2 + 0 + 0 =>  2.

Task 2: Summations

Submitted by: [41]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a list of positive numbers, @n.

   Write a script to find out the summations as described below.

Example 1

Input: @n = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Output: 42

    1 2 3  4  5
      2 5  9 14
        5 14 28
          14 42
             42

The nth Row starts with the second element of the (n-1)th row.
The following element is sum of all elements except first element of previous ro
w.
You stop once you have just one element in the row.

Example 2

Input: @n = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
Output: 70

    1 3  5  7  9
      3  8 15 24
         8 23 47
           23 70
              70
