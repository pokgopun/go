HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

Let us welcome November with a bang !!!

   Today is the first Monday of the month and it is the time to declare
   the champion of the weekly challenge.

Paulo Custodio

   With great pleasure, I announce, Paulo Custodio as the champion. As of
   today, he is ranked #24 with score 354 in the leader board. He is also
   ranked #3 with score 402 in the guest leader board. He is a regular
   contributor in Perl as well as Ada, Adb, Awk, Basic, Bc, Brainfuck, C,
   C++, D, Forth, Fortran, Lua, Pascal and Python.

Time to welcome new members

    1. Karishma Rajput joined the team as guest with contributions in
       [24]C, [25]C++ and [26]JavaScript.
    2. Robert DiCicco, from Little Rock, AR, joined the Team PWC as a Perl
       Hacker. He shared his solution in [27]Perl.

Am I being superactive in the last 2 weeks?

   In terms of guest contributions, I would say, yes. I have been
   contributing Perl solutions to Task #1 or Task #2 or both sometimes. I
   have even dared to start contributing in Raku well. But the most
   excitement bit is that I am back on guest contributions category too.
   In the last 2 weeks, I have translated Perl solutions to Java, Python
   and Swift. This has brought me back in the Top 20 guest contributors.

But then came a moment …

   I had my booster jab last Wednesday. The jab took me down the very next
   day. I was on the bed with high temperature. I had to take off sick
   from work. Friday was better but not fully functional. I kept myself
   invovled only in office related tasks. Saturday was the worst day,
   temperature going up and down. I was thinking, was it good idea to take
   the booster jab? In fact, the first two jabs didn’t do anything
   terrible. So I was hoing this would also go without much trouble. Here
   I was wrong. Life is so unpredictable. I was still unwell on Sunday.
   But I was looking forward to the T20 World Cup match between India and
   New Zealand in the second half of Sunday. It was kind of quater final
   match and India lost it very badly. Can you imagine? The loss didn’t
   lift my mood as I was already feeling down.

Then I decided …

   Enough is enough, I have to push myself and start processing all the
   pending Pull Requests from the Team PWC. I started at 8pm and finished
   at midnight. It was time to prepare the [28]Perl Weekly Newsletter. As
   some of you know, I am also co-editor of the weekly newsletter, Gabor
   Szabo, being the chief editor. I submitted the draft at about 5am. Then
   I started preparing for the new weekly challenge. This is the whole
   Sunday night story for me.

New ideas?

   Just a gentle reminder, the two champions, Adam Russell and Cheok-Yin
   Fung, started a discussion on new ideas for the weekly challenge.
   Please join them and share your views also. You can find the details
   [29]here.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Long Year

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find all the years between 1900 and 2100 which is a
   Long Year.

     A year is Long if it has 53 weeks.

[UPDATED][2021-11-01 16:20:00]: For more information about Long Year, please
refer to [47]wikipedia.

Expected Output

1903, 1908, 1914, 1920, 1925,
1931, 1936, 1942, 1948, 1953,
1959, 1964, 1970, 1976, 1981,
1987, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2009,
2015, 2020, 2026, 2032, 2037,
2043, 2048, 2054, 2060, 2065,
2071, 2076, 2082, 2088, 2093,
2099

TASK #2 › Lychrel Number

Submitted by: [48]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a number, 10 <= $n <= 1000.

   Write a script to find out if the given number is Lychrel number. To
   keep the task simple, we impose the following rules:
a. Stop if the number of iterations reached 500.
b. Stop if you end up with number >= 10_000_000.

[UPDATED][2021-11-01 16:20:00]: If you stop because of any of the above two
rules then we expect 1 as an output.

   According to [49]wikipedia:

     A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome
     through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and
     adding the resulting numbers.

Example 1

Input: $n = 56
Output: 0

After 1 iteration, we found palindrome number.
56 + 65 = 121

Example 2

Input: $n = 57
Output: 0

After 2 iterations, we found palindrome number.
 57 +  75 = 132
132 + 231 = 363

Example 3

Input: $n = 59
Output: 0

After 3 iterations, we found palindrome number.
 59 +  95 =  154
154 + 451 =  605
605 + 506 = 1111

   Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 7th November
   2021.
