HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #147 with the interview with the champion,
   [24]Peter Campbell Smith.

   Do you know about Early Bird Club?

   Well, it is a private club whose members get the first glimpse of the
   upcoming challenges before the general public. Anyone can join the club
   by just writing one line email to perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com. The
   club members also help me review the tasks. I would like to take the
   opportunity to say a very big THANK YOU to the members of the club.
   Believe it or not, we do our best to describe the task in such a way
   that you get the idea in the first instance. I accept failure on my
   behalf that you still find ambiguity some weeks. Please accept my
   apology if you find it difficult to follow the task. I will continue to
   work on it.

   Well done, Team PWC, for crossing the 100+ mark once again. Last time
   we breached the target was in the Week #141.

   As far as the guest contributions are concerned, for the second
   consecutive weeks, we reached the maximum so far i.e. 90. I am sure,
   very soon we would go past 100 mark. Like the week before, this week
   also the three main contributors are Abigail, Roger Bell_West and
   Laurent Rosenfeld. I am also contributing every week in Python, Java
   and Swift on top of Perl and Raku.

   Did you notice, I still call the team, Team PWC, even though we are now
   called The Weekly Challenge? Well I am emotionally attached to the
   name. Therefore I decided to keep calling Team PWC and nothing else. It
   feels great when other also refer with the same name.

   Any update with regard to the FREE T-shirt campaign?

   There has been no response from the remaining champions. I am still
   waiting for confirmations from 21 champions. This is a lot and I don’t
   to miss them. I would give another couple of weeks time. If I still
   don’t receive confirmation then I will go ahead without them. Sorry.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Truncatable Prime

Submitted by: [40]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 20 left-truncatable prime numbers in
   base 10.

     In number theory, a left-truncatable prime is a prime number which,
     in a given base, contains no 0, and if the leading left digit is
     successively removed, then all resulting numbers are primes.

Example

9137 is one such left-truncatable prime since 9137, 137, 37 and 7 are all prime
numbers.

TASK #2 › Pentagon Numbers

Submitted by: [41]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find the first pair of Pentagon Numbers whose sum and
   difference are also a Pentagon Number.

     Pentagon numbers can be defined as P(n) = n(3n - 1)/2.

Example

The first 10 Pentagon Numbers are:
1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117 and 145.

P(4) + P(7) = 22 + 70 = 92 = P(8)
but
P(4) - P(7) = |22 - 70| = 48 is not a Pentagon Number.

   2022.
