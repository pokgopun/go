HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Merry Christmas to all the members of Team PWC. I wish you all the
   happiness in the world.

   Last week for me was for the family. I spent quality time with kids. I
   have another week off left. I am looking forward to it. I hope and wish
   you also had great time with your loved ones. I would like to thank the
   dedicated and passionate members of Team PWC who still manage to
   contribute in the holiday season. I know it is not easy but you still
   did it. I suggest if you struggle for time for the weekly challenge
   then simply attempt only task one as it generally takes no time. I
   would like mention one name specially, Colin Crain, for being the
   one-man army when it comes to Perl Reviews. You have done a brilliant
   job. It is no longer a secret how much your work is appreciated by the
   Team PWC members.

   With the regard to the 1000 days T-shirt campaign, I haven’t had any
   response from the remaining champions. I can understand they are busy
   with the family. I am hoping in the new year they will find time to
   respond to my email.

   This is the last week of the year 2021, let me take this opportunity to
   say Good Bye on behalf of Team PWC.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Dot Product

Submitted by: [45]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given 2 arrays of same size, @a and @b.

   Write a script to implement Dot Product.

Example:

@a = (1, 2, 3);
@b = (4, 5, 6);

$dot_product = (1 * 4) + (2 * 5) + (3 * 6) => 4 + 10 + 18 => 32

TASK #2 › Palindromic Tree

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a string $s.

   Write a script to create a Palindromic Tree for the given string.

   I found this [47]blog exaplaining Palindromic Tree in detail.

Example 1:

Input: $s = 'redivider'
Output: r redivider e edivide d divid i ivi v

Example 2:

Input: $s = 'deific'
Output: d e i ifi f c

Example 3:

Input: $s = 'rotors'
Output: r rotor o oto t s

Example 4:

Input: $s = 'challenge'
Output: c h a l ll e n g

Example 5:

Input: $s = 'champion'
Output: c h a m p i o n

Example 6:

Input: $s = 'christmas'
Output: c h r i s t m a
