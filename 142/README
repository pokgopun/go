HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Today is the first Monday of the month. You guessed it right, time to
   declare the Champion of The Weekly Challenge. With great pride, I
   declare W. Luis Mochan as our next Champion. Luis joined the Team PWC
   in the Week 88. Till date, he has contributed 102 Perl solutions and 51
   blogs. He only missed 3 weeks ever i.e. 103, 104 and 105. He is
   currently ranked 30th with score 306 in the leaderboard. He also became
   the 52nd member qualified for the 1000 days celebration.

   Talking about the celebration, so far, we have received £582.81 in
   donations. As of today, 29 of 52 members have responded to my email. I
   am hoping in the next few days, remaining would get back with the
   details (T-shirt size and delivery address). I would like to thank each
   and every sponsors. Thanks to all members who shared the details with
   me. I can assure you that your data is in safe hands.

   I am keeping the [24]blog post for up to date. Please do check out if
   you are interested.

   As soon as I get ithe details of the remaining qualified members, I
   would start designing the T-shirt and prepare the order so that it can
   be dispatch on time.

   As you all know, we are running Advent Calendar for the 3rd time in a
   row. I would like to thank all the contributors to the [25]Advent
   Calendar 2021.

   Thank you, Peter Campbell Smith, for your [26]first blog of The Weekly
   Challenge.

   Recently joined member, Kaushik Tunuguntla, shared his first solutions
   in [27]Perl. Not only that he also shared the [28]blog post. Thank you,
   Kaushik.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
