HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Apology for the delay in the release of the weekly challenge.

   I would like to start the week with a good news, the fund for the 1000
   days T-shirt campaign is now £1029.74, thanks to all sponsors,
   specially last minute surprise sponsor, Pete Sergeant.

   I am just waiting to get the response from the remaining champions
   before I move to next stage of the campaign. As of today, I have
   received 32 confirmations out of 53. I know it is festive season,
   everyone is busy with family. I would appreciate if you could please
   take a few moments and reply to my email asap. For more updates, please
   check out the [24]blog post.

   Welcome back, Mark Senn, after a long break and thanks for the
   [25]contributions. Also thanks for introducing a new language, Wolfram.

   We had bonus review this week by our in-house Perl reviewer, Colin
   Crain. Thank you for the quality reviews every week.

   Talking about bonus, I am back with the YouTube Videos after nearly 5
   months. I had days off the work, so I did it 5 videos back to back. I
   hope you like the video. If you do please share with your friends.
   Thank You.

   If you want to checkout my previous videos then please do visit my
   [26]YouTube Channel. As of today, I have got 145 subscribers, not a big
   number but big enough to keep me motivated. Thank you once again all
   the subscribers.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

GUESTS

   Please find [55]past solutions by respected guests. Please share your
   creative solutions in other languages.

TASK #1 › Semiprime

Submitted by: [56]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate all Semiprime number <= 100.

   For more information about Semiprime, please checkout the [57]wikipedia
   page.

     In mathematics, a semiprime is a natural number that is the product
     of exactly two prime numbers. The two primes in the product may
     equal each other, so the semiprimes include the squares of prime
     numbers.

Example

10 is Semiprime as 10 = 2 x 5
15 is Semiprime as 15 = 3 x 5

TASK #2 › Ulam Sequence

Submitted by: [58]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given two positive numbers, $u and $v.

   Write a script to generate Ulam Sequence having at least 10 Ulam
   numbers where $u and $v are the first 2 Ulam numbers.

   For more information about Ulam Sequence, please checkout the
   [59]website.

     The standard Ulam sequence (the (1, 2)-Ulam sequence) starts with U1
     = 1 and U2 = 2. Then for n > 2, Un is defined to be the smallest
     integer that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one
     way and larger than all earlier terms.

Example 1

Input: $u = 1, $v = 2
Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18

Example 2

Input: $u = 2, $v = 3
Output: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 18, 19

Example 3

Input: $u = 2, $v = 5
Output: 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 23
     __________________________________________________________________

   Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 26th December
   2021.
