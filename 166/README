   Welcome to yet another fun Week #166, thanks to the exciting tasks by
   Ryan Thompson.

   Lets us welcome new member, Roman Kotelnikov with his guest

   Talking about guest contributions, this week we had contributions in

   I was pleasantly surprised to see [26]contributions by Saif Ahmed, our
   very [27]Champion of The Weekly Challenge after a long break.

   Well, we had another [28]Champion of The Weekly Challenge, Wanderdoc,

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Hexadecimal Words

Submitted by: [43]Ryan J Thompson
     __________________________________________________________________

   As an old systems programmer, whenever I needed to come up with a
   32-bit number, I would reach for the tired old examples like 0xDeadBeef
   and 0xC0dedBad. I want more!

   Write a program that will read from a dictionary and find 2- to
   8-letter words that can be “spelled” in hexadecimal, with the addition
   of the following letter substitutions:
     * o ⟶ 0 (e.g., 0xf00d = “food”)
     * l ⟶ 1
     * i ⟶ 1
     * s ⟶ 5
     * t ⟶ 7

   You can use your own dictionary or you can simply open
   ../../../data/dictionary.txt (relative to your script’s location in our
   [44]GitHub repository) to access the dictionary of common words from
   [45]Week #161.

Optional Extras (for an 0xAddedFee, of course!)

    1. Limit the number of “special” letter substitutions in any one
       result to keep that result at least somewhat comprehensible.
       (0x51105010 is an actual example from my sample solution you may
       wish to avoid!)
    2. Find phrases of words that total 8 characters in length (e.g.,
       0xFee1Face), rather than just individual words.

Task 2: K-Directory Diff

Submitted by: [46]Ryan J Thompson
     __________________________________________________________________

   Given a few (three or more) directories (non-recursively), display a
   side-by-side difference of files that are missing from at least one of
   the directories. Do not display files that exist in every directory.

   Since the task is non-recursive, if you encounter a subdirectory,
   append a /, but otherwise treat it the same as a regular file.

Example

   Given the following directory structure:
dir_a:
Arial.ttf  Comic_Sans.ttf  Georgia.ttf  Helvetica.ttf  Impact.otf  Verdana.ttf
Old_Fonts/

dir_b:
Arial.ttf  Comic_Sans.ttf  Courier_New.ttf  Helvetica.ttf  Impact.otf  Tahoma.tt
f  Verdana.ttf

dir_c:
Arial.ttf  Courier_New.ttf  Helvetica.ttf  Impact.otf  Monaco.ttf  Verdana.ttf

   The output should look similar to the following:
dir_a          | dir_b           | dir_c
-------------- | --------------- | ---------------
Comic_Sans.ttf | Comic_Sans.ttf  |
               | Courier_New.ttf | Courier_New.ttf
Georgia.ttf    |                 |
               |                 | Monaco.ttf
Old_Fonts/     |                 |
               | Tahoma.ttf      |
