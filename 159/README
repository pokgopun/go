HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the first weekly challenge of the holy month of Ramadan.

   Also today is the first Monday of the month and time to announce the
   next champion. With great pleasure I announce, Eric Cheung, as the
   Champion of the month. Eric is currently ranked #11 in the Guest
   Leaderboard. As of today he has contributed 78 solutions. The breakdown
   of his contributions are 63 Excel VBA and 15 Python solutions.

   Last few days have been really tough as I am having really bad cold.
   Somehow I managed to contribute to the last week challenge. I hope to
   continue as long as humanly possible.

   After a gap of 3 weeks, we breached the target once again. Last time we
   reached the target (106) was in the Week 154. This week we had 105
   contributions, thanks to each and every contributors.

   Enjoy !!!

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
