HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to a very special Week #169.

   Why so special?

   Well, we got two new members joining the Team PWC, [24]Stephen G Lynn
   and [25]habere-et-dispertire.

   There is another reason why it is so special. Thanks to the kind help
   by Lance Wicks, we finally have the design ready for the 1000 days
   celebration T-shirt. It is time to finalise the list of champions. I am
   hoping by next week, I will have the final list. Following that, I will
   place the order. Sincere apology for the delay.

   I missed the deadline to participate last week again. I find it hard to
   be regular. Talking about regular contributors, Laurent Rosenfeld is
   one of few who hardly missed a week. No wonder he is currently rank #1
   as of today.

   Welcome back [26]Bruce Gray and [27]Humberto Massa after a short break.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Brilliant Numbers

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 20 Brilliant Numbers.

     Brilliant numbers are numbers with two prime factors of the same
     length.

   The number should have exactly two prime factors, i.e. it’s the product
   of two primes of the same length.

   For example,
24287 = 149 x 163
24289 = 107 x 227

Therefore 24287 and 24289 are 2-brilliant numbers.
These two brilliant numbers happen to be consecutive as there are no even brilli
ant numbers greater than 14.

Output

4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 25, 35, 49, 121, 143, 169, 187, 209, 221, 247, 253, 289
, 299

Task 2: Achilles Numbers

Submitted by: [47]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 20 Achilles Numbers. Please checkout
   [48]wikipedia for more information.

     An Achilles number is a number that is powerful but imperfect (not a
     perfect power). Named after Achilles, a hero of the Trojan war, who
     was also powerful but imperfect.

     A positive integer n is a powerful number if, for every prime factor
     p of n, p^2 is also a divisor.

     A number is a perfect power if it has any integer roots (square
     root, cube root, etc.).

   For example 36 factors to (2, 2, 3, 3) - every prime factor (2, 3) also
   has its square as a divisor (4, 9). But 36 has an integer square root,
   6, so the number is a perfect power.

   But 72 factors to (2, 2, 2, 3, 3); it similarly has 4 and 9 as
   divisors, but it has no integer roots. This is an Achilles number.

Output

 72, 108,  200,  288,  392,  432,  500,  648,  675,  800,  864, 968, 972, 1125,
1152, 1323, 1352, 1372, 1568, 1800
