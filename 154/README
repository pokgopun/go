HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to yet another week full of factorials left right center. The
   magic of factorials did the trick. For the first time in the history of
   weekly challenge, we have received more guest contributions than the
   regular contributions. Two contributors stand out in the crowd,
   although every contributor is special. Abigail and Laurent Rosenfeld,
   you must have guessed it by now. I would like to thank Laurent for
   being one of the few who have been with us from day one. I would also
   like to thank him for the final push to get over the magic target.

   While I am talking about guest contributions, I would like to thank
   Bruce Gray for introducing a new guest language WebAssembly and shared
   his [24]contributions.

   At the time of releasing the weekly challenge, we received 106 guest
   contributions as compared to 90 regular contributions. Still the
   regular contributions beat the last week number i.e. 78 regular
   contributions. I hope we can reverse the number this week.

   As for my own contributions, I could only do [25]Perl this week because
   of lack of time. Having said, I would definitely try the challenge in
   Raku and Python if time permits this week.

   All the best for the weekly challenge, I hope you like it. Please do
   share your suggestions for the upcoming weekly challenges.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Missing Permutation

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given possible permutations of the string 'PERL'.
PELR, PREL, PERL, PRLE, PLER, PLRE, EPRL, EPLR, ERPL,
ERLP, ELPR, ELRP, RPEL, RPLE, REPL, RELP, RLPE, RLEP,
LPER, LPRE, LEPR, LRPE, LREP

   Write a script to find any permutations missing from the list.

TASK #2 › Padovan Prime

Submitted by: [47]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   A Padovan Prime is a Padovan Number that’s also prime.

   In number theory, the Padovan sequence is the sequence of integers P(n)
   defined by the initial values.
P(0) = P(1) = P(2) = 1

   and then followed by
P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)

   First few Padovan Numbers are as below:
1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, ...

   Write a script to compute first 10 distinct Padovan Primes.

Expected Output

2, 3, 5, 7, 37, 151, 3329, 23833, 13091204281, 3093215881333057
     __________________________________________________________________

   Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 6th March 2022.
