Perl Weekly Challenge - 003

   Sunday, Apr 7, 2019| Tags: Perl, Raku

   Last week challenge turned out to be a cakewalk for Perl 6 hackers.
   This shows my lack of knowledge of Perl 6. I have requested our inhouse
   Perl 6 experts to share some challenging questions. I already received
   few and kept in the challenge bank. I will use it in the coming weeks.
   Credit will be given to the hacker when published. We highly recommend
   that you submit you solutions as PR to the [14]repository. If you need
   help with regard to submitting Pull Request, there is handy [15]guide.
   A gentle reminder, please donâ€™t try to golf your solution. We are
   looking for unique way to solve the problem. Last week, newly joined
   member even submit test script, which is handy but not required. Also
   please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of Perl
   or Raku. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case anyone
   (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library as
   much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the language.
   We encourage you to blog about your solution, focus on how you achieve
   the result. If you do blog then please share with us.

   Last but not the least if you have any suggestions for future
   challenges then please do share with us. Good luck and have fun.

Challenge #1

     Create a script to generate 5-smooth numbers, whose prime divisors
     are less or equal to 5. They are also called Hamming/Regular/Ugly
     numbers. For more information, please check this [16]wikipedia.

Challenge #2

     Create a script that generates Pascal Triangle. Accept number of
     rows from the command line. The Pascal Triangle should have at least
     3 rows. For more information about Pascal Triangle, check this
     [17]wikipedia page.

   Last date to submit the solution 6 pm (UK Time) Sunday 14th April 2019.

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

   If you have any suggestions or ideas then please do share with us.
