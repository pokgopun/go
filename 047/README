   We are pleased to announce that we have found Raku Reviewer to cover
   the temporary break by Laurent Rosenfeld. Any guess? He is the coolest
   kid in the team, Ryan Thompson. I would like to mention another gem
   from the team, Ulrich Rieke, who is a star contributor. He has been
   contributing regularly in Perl, Raku, C++ and Haskell.

   You must have noticed there is a fixed set of members who blog about
   their solutions every week. There are handful who blogs occassionally.
   Last week, Noud Aldenhoven, felt the solution to the Task #2 needed to
   be blog about. Hence, he [14]blogged for the first time.

   I have been thinking of taking part in the weekly challenge for a long
   time but couldn’t do it because of lack of time. The wait is finally
   over, I have now shared my [15]first contributions. I must make it
   clear that I wont be taking part in Monthly Winner competition.

   Last but not the least, I woud like to thank each and every member for
   their support and encouragement.
