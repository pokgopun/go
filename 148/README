HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #148 with a new member [24]Marton Polgar. Marton
   shared solutions in [25]Raku in the very first week.

   I get excited everytime, I come across blog post by fellow team
   members. Last week, Roger Bell_West shared very inspiring [26]blog
   post. Abigail is the leader in the guest contributions category. I am
   thankful to all contributors for sharing the knowledge with us.

   Inspired by fellow team members, I also started contributing in guest
   languages. As of today, my ranking is #16 with 45 guest contributions
   which is nothing as compare to Abigail humungous figure of 1176. At one
   point, I remember, I slipped to rank #20. The best of my guest
   contribution is that I finally found the courage to share solutions in
   Python. I must admit, I haven’t fallen in love with Python yet. Having
   said, I am going to continue as long as I have spare time.

   The coming Sunday 23rd Jan 2022, I have set the deadline for the
   confirmation from the champions. On Monday, I will prepare the final
   list of champions for the FREE T-shirt. I have included Peter Campbell
   Smith to the list as he is the recent champion of the weekly challenge.
   I request all the champions who haven’t shared the postal address and
   T-shirt size, please do so as soon as possible. For updates, you can
   check out the [27]blog post.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Eban Numbers

Submitted by: [45]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate all Eban Numbers <= 100.

     An Eban number is a number that has no letter ‘e’ in it when the
     number is spelled in English (American or British).

2, 4, 6, 30, 32 are the first 5 Eban numbers.

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 5 Cardano Triplets.

     A triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) is called a Cardano Triplet
     if it satisfies the below condition.

   Cardano Triplets

Example

(2,1,5) is the first Cardano Triplets.
