   Welcome [24]PokGoPun to the Team PWC. We now have 250 members in the
   team.

   Last week, we had the opportunity to interview the latest champion,
   [25]Alexander Pankoff. It was pleasure knowing him. Please do checkout
   to find out more about him.

   Lubos Kolouch shared solution in [26]Java for the first time. He has
   also shared in Python and PHP in the past. While talking about guest
   contributors, I would like to mention one more name, Eric Cheung. He
   was introduced to the weekly challenge by fellow member, Cheok-Yin
   Fung. He is currently ranked #12 and recently overtook Cheok-Yin Fung.

   Enjoy the week with the another set of tasks. Good luck team.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Left Factorials

Submitted by: [49]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to compute Left Factorials of 1 to 10. Please refer
   [50]OEIS A003422 for more information.

Expected Output:

1, 2, 4, 10, 34, 154, 874, 5914, 46234, 409114

TASK #2 › Factorions

Submitted by: [51]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given an integer, $n.

   Write a script to figure out if the given integer is factorion.

     A factorion is a natural number that equals the sum of the
     factorials of its digits.

Example 1:

Input: $n = 145
Output: 1

    Since 1! + 4! + 5! => 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

Example 2:

Input: $n = 123
Output: 0

    Since 1! + 2! + 3! => 1 + 2 + 6 <> 123
     __________________________________________________________________

   Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 27th February
   2022.
