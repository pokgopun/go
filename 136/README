What a week it was !!!

   The Week #135 was special in many ways, please let me share the
   secrets. We breached the 100+ target once again, thanks to each and
   every members of Team PWC. Last time, we did it was in the Week #127.
   As far as guest contributions are concerned, the team didn’t disappoint
   us either. I aim for 50+ guest contributions, personally. Luckily last
   two weeks, we achieved the target. Most of the credit goes to Abigail
   when it comes to guest contributiobs. He does the bulk every week.

Anything else special happens last week?

   Well, you all know, I used to contribute Raku solutions long time ago.
   I have also contributed in Swift as well. Last week, I finally decided
   to get back contributing in [24]Raku. Not only that I contributed in
   [25]Swift as well. I surprised myself by contributing in [26]Python for
   the first time. I have been waiting for easy enough task to get my
   first contribution out. The Week #135 finally gave me the opportunity.
   I didn’t stop there and contributed [27]Java solution as well. The end
   result of all these guest contributions, is I am back in the Top 20
   guest contributors. I used to be in the Top 15 long time ago then I
   started slipping down. And at one time, I was dropped to 21st position.
   I am happy to find the positive energy in me. Fingers crossed, I hope
   it stays there for sometime. One thing that I wanted to do for months
   is that doing live coding session. I will do my best to get my hand
   dirty with some simple live coding. I really enjoy it. I have had many
   encouraging messages with regard to my live coding session. I would
   like to take this opportunity to thank all the subscribers for the
   support and encouragement.

Sunday morning didn’t start on happy note for me, why?

   I lost my Sky Broadband connection. I panicked as it is so difficult to
   manage all the routine tasks without internet connection. I called the
   support team and they said some maintenance work is going on in my
   area. It would take around 24 hours to get the connection back. I
   immediately shared the news with the team on [28]Twitter. The comments
   I received for my post brought smile back on my face. I loved the
   positivity among my friends on the various social platform. I am glad I
   choose the right people around me. Luckily I didn’t have to wait that
   long, I got the connection back around 10pm. Every member of my
   immediate family knows how busy I am on Sunday normally. I spent the
   afternoon watching the T20 World Cup 2021 match between India and
   Pakistan. The humiliating defeat of the Indian team really upset me.
   For the first time, my 11 year old daughter watched the match with me.
   To my surprise, she was supporting the Pakistan team. She was very
   happy to say the least in the end. Never mind, we will get the
   opportunity to take the glory back.

What else is going on?

   [29]Adam Russell and [30]Cheok-Yin Fung, the two champions, came
   together started really interesting discussion. I would like to share
   this with the rest of team. Please let me know what do you think by
   your comments in the [31]thread.

Raku contributions need an expert reviewer.

   We have been waiting for a volunteer to help us review the Raku
   contributions just like how Colin Crain has been doing for Perl
   solutions. I don’t expect one person to do it all. Even if you can do
   it one or two weeks that would be great. Please let me know if you have
   spare time.

Anything else?

   As you all know, we have dedicated space for Damian Conway and Andrew
   Shitov (our inhouse Raku expert and reviewer) every week in the weekly
   [32]Recaps blog. I am thinking of adding one more to showcase the
   collection of Abigail regex magic. It is for my own benefit, so that I
   don’t have to look around anywher else. Right now, I am on a very tight
   schedule to fit this work. I was wondering, if anyone from the team can
   help me in this work.

Hacktoberfest is coming to an end soon.

   You have one more week to participate in the ongoing the annual event
   and win a specially designed T-shirt. Mind you, it would be delivered
   to your door step for FREE anywhere in the world. If you are looking
   for ideas then why not take part in the weekly challenge and win the
   prize.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Two Friendly

Submitted by: [48]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given 2 positive numbers, $m and $n.

   Write a script to find out if the given two numbers are Two Friendly.

     Two positive numbers, m and n are two friendly when gcd(m, n) = 2 ^
     p where p > 0. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of a set of numbers
     is the largest positive number that divides all the numbers in the
     set without remainder.

Example 1

    Input: $m = 8, $n = 24
    Output: 1

    Reason: gcd(8,24) = 8 => 2 ^ 3

Example 2

    Input: $m = 26, $n = 39
    Output: 0

    Reason: gcd(26,39) = 13

Example 3

    Input: $m = 4, $n = 10
    Output: 1

    Reason: gcd(4,10) = 2 => 2 ^ 1

TASK #2 › Fibonacci Sequence

Submitted by: [49]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a positive number $n.

   Write a script to find how many different sequences you can create
   using Fibonacci numbers where the sum of unique numbers in each
   sequence are the same as the given number.

     Fibonacci Numbers: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, …

Example 1

Input:  $n = 16
Output: 4

Reason: There are 4 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbe
rs
i.e. (3 + 13), (1 + 2 + 13), (3 + 5 + 8) and (1 + 2 + 5 + 8).

Example 2

Input:  $n = 9
Output: 2

Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbe
rs
i.e. (1 + 3 + 5) and (1 + 8).

Example 3

Input:  $n = 15
Output: 2

Reason: There are 2 possible sequences that can be created using Fibonacci numbe
rs
i.e. (2 + 5 + 8) and (2 + 13).
