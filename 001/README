A New Week a New Challenge

   Sunday, Mar 24, 2019| Tags: Perl, Raku

   Welcome to the first task of the “Perl Weekly Challenge” event. Every
   Monday, we are going to propose 2 challenges, one aimed at Beginners
   and another for Experts. However you are free to choose the challenge
   you fancy. You can even attempt to solve both. As you know the choice
   of languages are Perl and Raku. You can solve one challenge in Perl and
   other in Raku, if you like.

Challenge #1

     Write a script to replace the character ‘e’ with ‘E’ in the string
     ‘Perl Weekly Challenge’. Also print the number of times the
     character ‘e’ is found in the string.

Challenge #2

     Write a one-liner to solve the FizzBuzz problem and print the
     numbers 1 through 20. However, any number divisible by 3 should be
     replaced by the word ‘fizz’ and any divisible by 5 by the word
     ‘buzz’. Those numbers that are both divisible by 3 and 5 become
     ‘fizzbuzz’.

   This challenge was proposed by @oneandoneis2 as DM on Twitter. Last
   date to submit the solution 6 pm (UK Time) Sunday 31st March 2019.

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

   If you have any suggestions or ideas then please do share with us.
