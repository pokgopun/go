HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to yet another fun week, thanks to all the dedicated members of
   Team PWC.

   I would like to mention one name, Laurent Rosenfeld, one of the few who
   stayed with us from day one. He is currently ranked #1 in the leader
   board. He has maintained a big lead, no immediate threat to his place.
   As of today, he has contributed 291 Perl, 297 Raku and 219 blog.
   Similarly, in the guest leaders, Abigail is currently ranked #1. His
   place is also very secured just like Laurent Rosenfeld.

   Talking about ranks, my position in the leader board is under threat
   because of my irregular contributions. My current rank #15 is no longer
   safe. There are immediate threat from Duncan C. White and Paulo
   Custodio. Last week, once again I missed the boat, unfortunately.

   Welcome back, Simon Proctor, we missed you. Thanks for your Raku
   [24]contributions.

   Thank you, Paulo Custodio, for your contributions mostly Perl.

   Robert DiCicco has been consistent as well with his Perl, Raku and few
   other guest contributions too.

   I wish you all the best and good luck.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Four Is Magic

Submitted by: [42]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a positive number, $n < 10.

   Write a script to generate english text sequence starting with the
   English cardinal representation of the given number, the word ‘is’ and
   then the English cardinal representation of the count of characters
   that made up the first word, followed by a comma. Continue until you
   reach four.

Example 1:

Input: $n = 5
Output: Five is four, four is magic.

Example 2:

Input: $n = 7
Output: Seven is five, five is four, four is magic.

Example 3:

Input: $n = 6
Output: Six is three, three is five, five is four, four is magic.

TASK #2 › Equilibrium Index

Submitted by: [43]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are give an array of integers, @n.

   Write a script to find out the Equilibrium Index of the given array, if
   found.

     For an array A consisting n elements, index i is an equilibrium
     index if the sum of elements of subarray A[0…i-1] is equal to the
     sum of elements of subarray A[i+1…n-1].

Example 1:

Input: @n = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: @n = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Output: -1 as no Equilibrium Index found.

Example 3:

Input: @n = (2, 4, 2)
Output: 1
