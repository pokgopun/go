HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to Week #152, a rather quiet one, where we received 68 regular
   contributions and 45 guest contributions. It didn’t trouble me much,
   which is good in a way. Hopefully it would bounce back this week.

   `Just an update, I am working on the design of the T-shirt. I will
   update you with regard to the design as soon as I am done.”

   Good luck with the fun tasks.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Triangle Sum Path

Submitted by: [39]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a triangle array.

   Write a script to find the minimum sum path from top to bottom.

Example 1:

Input: $triangle = [ [1], [5,3], [2,3,4], [7,1,0,2], [6,4,5,2,8] ]

                1
               5 3
              2 3 4
             7 1 0 2
            6 4 5 2 8

Output: 8

    Minimum Sum Path = 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 2 => 8

Example 2:

Input: $triangle = [ [5], [2,3], [4,1,5], [0,1,2,3], [7,2,4,1,9] ]

                5
               2 3
              4 1 5
             0 1 2 3
            7 2 4 1 9

Output: 9

    Minimum Sum Path = 5 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 => 9

TASK #2 › Rectangle Area

Submitted by: [40]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given coordinates bottom-left and top-right corner of two
   rectangles in a 2D plane.

   Write a script to find the total area covered by the two rectangles.

Example 1:

Input: Rectangle 1 => (-1,0), (2,2)
       Rectangle 2 => (0,-1), (4,4)

Output: 22

Example 2:

Input: Rectangle 1 => (-3,-1), (1,3)
       Rectangle 2 => (-1,-3), (2,2)

Output: 25
