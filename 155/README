HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #155. It is hard to believe the number. At times I
   feel like taking short break from the routine that I have been
   following for the last 3 years (almost). But then when I read the
   positive comments week after week by the dedicated members, I drop the
   idea completely. Here are some for you.

1. [24]Ulrich Rieke

     thank you for the fine tasks this week! Apparently, the prime number
     theme offers quite a number of variations. For me, trying to solve
     the tasks was a little distraction from the endless and permanent
     stream of sad news from the east of our common continent.

2. [25]Duncan C. White

     first nice and easy, second finds the first 8 Padovan Primes
     quickly, doesn’t find 9th or 10th PP in reasonable time and space.

3. [26]Flavio Poletti

     Hi! Please find my contribution for this week’s challenge. Thanks
     for all the energy!

4. Marton Polgar

     thank you for the challenges as usual; very interesting second task
     indeed, as gfldex pointed out. :)

   It is not that everything is rosy but lets change the topic.

   First Monday of the month and time to declare another champion. It
   gives me immense pleasure to announce, Robert DiCicco, as our next
   champion. He is relative new to the team but in a short time he has
   become very prominent contributor. As of today, he has contributed 29
   Perl and 6 Raku solutions. He is currently ranked #37 in the Guest
   Leaders board. He has so far contributed 6 Ruby and 4 Tcl solutions.

   Let us welcome another member to the team, [27]Jeff Armstrong. He
   shared his [28]Raku solutions in the first week. Thank You.

   Talking about contributions, I missed the opportunity to contribute
   once again. I always encourage others to contribute to Task #1 at least
   if they are running short of time since it usually doesn’t take much
   time. Here I am, not following my own advice. I am going through many
   ups and downs in my head right now. I will get back to the track soon,
   promise.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Fortunate Numbers

Submitted by: [50]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to produce first 8 Fortunate Numbers (unique and
   sorted).

   According to [51]Wikipedia

     A Fortunate number, named after Reo Fortune, is the smallest integer
     m > 1 such that, for a given positive integer n, pn# + m is a prime
     number, where the primorial pn# is the product of the first n prime
     numbers.

Expected Output

3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, 37

TASK #2 › Pisano Period

Submitted by: [52]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find the period of the 3rd Pisano Period.

     In number theory, the nth Pisano period, written as π(n), is the
     period with which the sequence of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo n
     repeats.

   The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the integer sequence:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 41
81, 6765, ...

   For any integer n, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers F(i) taken modulo
   n is periodic. The Pisano period, denoted π(n), is the value of the
   period of this sequence. For example, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers
   modulo 3 begins:
0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1,
0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1,
0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, ...

   This sequence has period 8, so π(3) = 8.
