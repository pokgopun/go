HEADLINES

   Today is the first Monday of the month and it is time to announce the
   next champion, Alexander Pankoff, currently ranked #49 with 62
   contributions in Perl. Last week, for the first time, he shared two
   blogs, [24]#1 and [25]#2.

   Let us welcome a new member, [26]Robert Ransbottom, an expert in Raku.
   He shared his first contributions in [27]Raku with us.

   We reached the milestone after a gap of 2 weeks. Last time we reached
   100+ contributions in the Week #147. Guest contribution is also
   catching up, we received 75 contributions in the Week #150 in 36
   different languages.

   Let’s keep sharing code and knowledge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Binary Tree Depth

Submitted by: [47]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given binary tree.

   Write a script to find the minimum depth.

     The minimum depth is the number of nodes from the root to the
     nearest leaf node (node without any children).

Example 1:

Input: '1 | 2 3 | 4 5'

                1
               / \
              2   3
             / \
            4   5

Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: '1 | 2 3 | 4 *  * 5 | * 6'

                1
               / \
              2   3
             /     \
            4       5
             \
              6
Output: 3

TASK #2 › Rob The House

Submitted by: [48]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are planning to rob a row of houses, always starting with the first
   and moving in the same direction. However, you can’t rob two adjacent
   houses.

   Write a script to find the highest possible gain that can be achieved.

Example 1:

Input: @valuables = (2, 4, 5);
Output: 7

If we rob house (index=0) we get 2 and then the only house we can rob is house (
index=2) where we have 5.
So the total valuables in this case is (2 + 5) = 7.

Example 2:

Input: @valuables = (4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 3);
Output: 13

The best choice would be to first rob house (index=0) then rob house (index=3) t
hen finally house (index=5).
This would give us 4 + 6 + 3 =13.
