HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #168.

   Let us all welcome guest Michael DiCicco from Little Rock, AR sharing
   his first contributions in [24]Java and [25]Python.

   What a coincidence, we have two members sharing the same surname
   DiCicco and he is none other than our very own champion [26]Robert
   DiCicco.

   Today is the first Monday of the month and time to declare our next
   champion. With great pleasure, I announce Robert Ransbottom as the next
   champion. He joined the Team PWC in the Week #150. As of today, he has
   contributed 31 solutions in Raku.

   The task Gamma Function of last week turned out to be untouchable.
   Could it be, it is more of mathy than the most. However, our champion,
   [27]Ryan Thompson took all the trouble to give us the lighter side in
   his [28]blog post.

   Finally I got the time to participate in the weekly challenge. It was
   partly because I wanted to try the latest release Perl v5.36. After a
   short gap of two weeks, I share my solution to the task [29]Circular
   Prime in Perl v5.36. I am looking forward to Colin Crain comment on the
   same, if at all, if it’s worth his time.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

   Please find [44]past solutions by respected guests. Please share your
   creative solutions in other languages.

Task 1: Perrin Prime

Submitted by: [45]Roger Bell_West
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Perrin sequence is defined to start with [3, 0, 2]; after that,
   term N is the sum of terms N-2 and N-3. (So it continues 3, 2, 5, 5, 7,
   ….)

     A Perrin prime is a number in the Perrin sequence which is also a
     prime number.

   Calculate the first 13 Perrin Primes.

   f(13) = [2, 3, 5, 7, 17, 29, 277, 367, 853, 14197, 43721, 1442968193,
   792606555396977]

Task 2: Home Prime

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given an integer greater than 1.

   Write a script to find the home prime of the given number.

   In number theory, the home prime HP(n) of an integer n greater than 1
   is the prime number obtained by repeatedly factoring the increasing
   concatenation of prime factors including repetitions.

   Further information can be found on [47]Wikipedia and [48]OEIS.

Example

   As given in the Wikipedia page,
HP(10) = 773, as 10 factors as 2×5 yielding HP10(1) = 25, 25 factors as 5×5 yiel
ding HP10(2) = HP25(1) = 55, 55 = 5×11 implies HP10(3) = HP25(2) = HP55(1) = 511
, and 511 = 7×73 gives HP10(4) = HP25(3) = HP55(2) = HP511(1) = 773, a prime num
ber.
