   Start of the year, we have two new members joining the Team PWC. First
   is Moray Jones and the second is Mohammad Khalid Anwar. Did you notice
   the similarity between my name and Khalid? Well he is my younger
   brother from Pune, India. It took me so long to convince him to join
   the weekly challenge. I am glad he finally did join us. Moray shared
   solution in [24]Raku whereas Khalid shared solutions in [25]Perl and
   [26]C++ in the first week.

   Another interesting event happened last week. For the first time in the
   history of The Weekly Challenge, we received same guest contributions
   (89) as the Perl and Raku combined contributions (89). It is also the
   best week for guest contributions beating the previous best figure of
   86 contributions in the Week #109. The biggest contributors are
   Abigail, Laurent Rosenfeld and Roger Bell_West.

Guest Contributors

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
