Perl Weekly Challenge - 013

   Sunday, Jun 16, 2019| Tags: Perl, Raku

   Couple of weeks ago, I tweet below about a surprise for all registered
   members.

   PWC 012 Tweet

   It is now time to annouce the surprise. Few weeks ago, Peter Sergeant
   of [14]PerlCareers contacted me by email and offered to sponsor the
   weekly challenge to make it more attractive. He offered the winner of
   weekly challenge $50 Amazon Voucher. We, Peter and I, worked out the
   formalities and other related issues. All registered members who
   contribute to the weekly challenge for the week will go into the ballot
   box. To increase your chance to be the winner, just contribute more
   solutions i.e. in Perl and in Raku. You could even blog about your
   solutions. For every solutions we receive before the deadline, we would
   put one entry in the ballot box. So for example, if a member submits
   solutions to all the three challenges in Perl and Raku with blog, then
   we would put 7 entries for the member.

   From next week onwward, just minute before the launch of the weekly
   challenge, I will pick one winner randomly from the ballot box. This
   gives member some more time to submit the solutions past the actual
   deadline (6 pm UK time). The winner name would then be announce with
   the release of weekly challenge. I will email the winner $50 Amazon
   voucher code shortly after the release of the challenge. Please make
   sure, we have your valid email address, just in case. In return we
   would love to receive the acknowledgement of the Amazon voucher.

   We will have our first winner with the release of [Perl Weekly
   Challenge #014]. This makes the [Perl Weekly Challenge #013] contender
   for the first competitve weekly challengeRakuod luck and all the very
   best for the weekly challenge.
