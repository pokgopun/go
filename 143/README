HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   First thing first, let us [24]Meet The Champion - W. Luis Mochan.

   I am sure, you all wanted to know about the 1000 days T-shirt campaign.
   I have had few more responses from the champions. There are still quite
   a lot members who have not replied to my email. I am waiting for the
   response before I move to next stage. I would recommend to check out
   the [25]blog post for more update. Thanks to all the sponsors.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Calculator

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a string, $s, containing mathematical expression.

   Write a script to print the result of the mathematical expression. To
   keep it simple, please only accept + - * ().

Example 1:

    Input: $s = "10 + 20 - 5"
    Output: 25

Example 2:

    Input: $s = "(10 + 20 - 5) * 2"
    Output: 50

TASK #2 › Stealthy Number

Submitted by: [47]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a positive number, $n.

   Write a script to find out if the given number is Stealthy Number.

     A positive integer N is stealthy, if there exist positive integers
     a, b, c, d such that a * b = c * d = N and a + b = c + d + 1.

Example 1

Input: $n = 36
Output: 1

Since 36 = 4 (a) * 9 (b) = 6 (c) * 6 (d) and 4 (a) + 9 (b) = 6 (c) + 6 (d) + 1.

Example 2

Input: $n = 12
Output: 1

Since 2 * 6 = 3 * 4 and 2 + 6 = 3 + 4 + 1

Example 3

Input: $n = 6
Output: 0

Since 2 * 3 = 1 * 6 but 2 + 3 != 1 + 6 + 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   2021.
