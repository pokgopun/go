HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Today, we are 960 days old, very close to the target of 4-digits
   number. Congratulations to Team PWC for the support and encouragements.
   I am happy to see the growing popularity of guest contributions. I am
   glad to contribute as well although my contribution is not significant,
   still it feels nice. Last week, I could only share [24]Java and
   [25]Python. The best part of my contributions was it is all focussed on
   unit testing. I couldn’t get Swift unit testing working in Ubuntu, so I
   skipped it. I will give it a go next time if time permits. I really
   enjoyed unit testing in Java and Python. It was my first attempt in
   Python. I will continue practice in coming weeks. Sometimes I wonder
   how Abigail, Roger Bell_West, Ulrich Rieke, Laurent Rosenfeld and
   others can do so many different programming languages. The quality is
   always the best of all. I always take the help from others everytime I
   am stuck. There is so much to learn from others. I am shameless when it
   comes to asking for help. Luckily I get help instantly everytime I post
   my questions on Twitter.

   I have also recently started contributing in [26]Raku as well. Right
   now, I aim to do atleast one task (easy one) in Perl, Raku, Java,
   Python and Swift. I would appreciate if anyone can help me with unit
   testing in Swift. I have got a very basic [27]example available on
   GitHub. It is broken at the moment. I would appreciate if you can help
   me get it working. I spent all Saturday without any luck. I gave up in
   the end as I had others urgent task to complete. The whole point of
   learning Swift is so that I can build mobile app for iOS. I have bought
   Mac Mini and external monitor for the same. I did one small application
   with the online help. May be one day, I will create an app for the
   weekly challenge. I know it is an ambitious project but nothing wrong
   in aiming high.

   I have been planning to do some Perl live coding for months now without
   any luck. It is just a matter of getting started then it becomes easy.
   I know I can do it as I have done it in the past. In the past, I used
   to blog as well talking about Perl and Raku. Honestly speaking, I
   prefer live coding than blogging. I have plenty of holidays left this
   year. I am planning to take long break around the Christmas so that I
   can do couple of pending projects. One of them is to get first draft of
   my Perl book ready for review. It is moving along very slowly. I have
   to sit back and set the priority right.

   I would like to thank each and everyone for the kind message. I am
   feeling lot better now. Everytime I receive a message from team member,
   it feels great. It gives me extra energy to do more. Sometimes, I
   receive message with the Pull Request as well. It brings smile on my
   face everytime I read it. Thank you everyone, once again, for the
   support and encouragement.

   If you have any suggestions to make the weekly challenge better than
   please do share with me.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Workdays

Submitted by: [40]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a year, $year in 4-digits form.

   Write a script to calculate the total number of workdays in the given
   year.

     For the task, we consider, Monday - Friday as workdays.

Example 1

Input: $year = 2021
Output: 261

Example 2

Input: $year = 2020
Output: 262

TASK #2 › Split Number

Submitted by: [41]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a perfect square.

   Write a script to figure out if the square root the given number is
   same as sum of 2 or more splits of the given number.

Example 1

Input: $n = 81
Output: 1

Since, sqrt(81) = 8 + 1

Example 2

Input: $n = 9801
Output: 1

Since, sqrt(9801) = 98 + 0 + 1

Example 3

Input: $n = 36
Output: 0

Since, sqrt(36) != 3 + 6
