HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to Week #172 of the weekly challenge.

   Today is the first Monday of the month and time to announce the
   champion. Proud to declare PokGoPun as our next champion. He is
   relatively new to the Team PWC. In such a short time, he has reached
   rank #12 in Guest Leaders. His contributing languages are Perl and Go.

   We have done interview with the last champion, Robert Ransbottom,
   please checkout and find out more about him in the [24]interview.

   Recently brian d foy contacted me and offered signed hard copy of his
   latest Perl book i.e. [25]Learning Perl, 8th edition. I am given free
   hand to nominate the member to receive the FREE book and delivered too
   at no extra cost. I am happy to nominate, Colin Crain, our most popular
   and famous Perl Reviewer. I will share the details with brian d foy in
   the next few days. Next week, we are going to have another nomination.

   Thanks to the contributions of Team PWC, we have reached the milestone
   of 100+ contributions 3 weeks in a row. Even the guest contributions
   also peaked after a long time with 75 contributions in 25 languages by
   15 guests.

   Welcome back, Bartosz Jarzyna and thanks for sharing solutions in
   [26]Perl, [27]Raku, [28]C and [29]Pascal.

   Welcome back, Humberto Massa after a short break. Thank you for
   contribtions in [30]Raku.

   Welcome back, Kjetil Skotheim and thanks for sharing solutions in
   [31]Perl.

   Even, I got the time to do both, [32]Task #1 and [33]Task #2 this week
   in Perl, usually I have only time for Task #1.

   Last but not the least, we have received the confirmation from
   champions contacted recently. Altogether, we now have confirmations
   from 38 champions. One more champion is going to be added to the list
   i.e. PokGoPun. As soon as I get the confirmation, I will get the
   T-shirt printing ordered. You can checkout the latest update in the
   [34]blog post.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
