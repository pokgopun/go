HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome Daniel Pfeiffer to the Team PWC. We are now strong team of 252
   members.

   The interview with our latest champion, [24]Robert DiCicco, is live
   now. It was great knowing him. Robert is so lucky to be able to spend
   time coding even after retirement. Ideally I would also want to spend
   my time with Perl post retirement. Given a choice, I would retire today
   and spend every minute doing Perl. Having said, I know I have
   responsibilities and I have to fulfill it with utmost sincerity.

   In my experience, when I enjoy what I do then life is super fun. I also
   know, not every day can be the same. In the current time, it is very
   important to keep the negative thoughts away. Running the weekly
   challenge contest helps me a lot. All credit goes to every members of
   Team PWC. Unfortunately another week gone and no time to contribute to
   the weekly challenge. Luckily there was plenty of contributions by the
   team members. Above all, the [25]Perl Review by Colin Crain kept me
   engaged. When I see my name mentioned in the review then it is always a
   pride moment for me.

   Last 3 weeks contributions by Team PWC are 95, 104 and 97. The numbers
   are very encouraging. Even guest contributions of last 3 weeks are 116,
   73 and 87. Overall contributions in the last 3 years (nearly) is
   14,310.

   Last but not least, I am little busy these days and hence the delay in
   the design/order of T-shirt for the big event. Please bear with me.

   Have fun with the weekly challenge. Please do share your ideas to make
   it fun for everyone.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Pernicious Numbers

Submitted by: [45]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to permute first 10 Pernicious Numbers.

     A pernicious number is a positive integer which has prime number of
     ones in its binary representation.

   The first pernicious number is 3 since binary representation of 3 =
   (11) and 1 + 1 = 2, which is a prime.

Expected Output

3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

TASK #2 › Weird Number

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given number, $n > 0.

   Write a script to find out if the given number is a Weird Number.

   According to [47]Wikipedia, it is defined as:

     The sum of the proper divisors (divisors including 1 but not itself)
     of the number is greater than the number, but no subset of those
     divisors sums to the number itself.

Example 1:

Input: $n = 12
Output: 0

Since the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which sum to 16; but 2 +
4 + 6 = 12.

Example 2:

Input: $n = 70
Output: 1

As the proper divisors of 70 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 35; these sum to 74, bu
t no subset of these sums to 70.
