HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #149 with a good news that Pete Sergeant has
   promised to sponsor the monthly prize for another 12 months. I would
   like to take this opportunity to thank, Pete, for the support and
   encouragement.

   As shared last week, 23rd Jan 2022 was the last day for submitting the
   details by the eligible champions. So, the final list has total of 32
   eligible members. I will now start the work on the design. I will share
   the design as soon as I am done. Or if you have any suggestions then
   please do share with me.

   Last week was very busy for me and I missed the deadline to submit the
   solutions. I will try to find time this week to get back on track, wish
   me luck.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Fibonacci Digit Sum

Submitted by: [38]Roger Bell_West
     __________________________________________________________________

   Given an input $N, generate the first $N numbers for which the sum of
   their digits is a Fibonacci number.

Example

f(20)=[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26, 30, 32, 35, 41, 44]

TASK #2 › Largest Square

Submitted by: [39]Roger Bell_West
     __________________________________________________________________

   Given a number base, derive the largest perfect square with no repeated
   digits and return it as a string. (For base>10, use ‘A’..‘Z’.)

Example:

    f(2)="1"
    f(4)="3201"
    f(10)="9814072356"
    f(12)="B8750A649321"
     __________________________________________________________________
