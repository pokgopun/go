HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #164 with new member Luiz Felipe from Brazil. Thank
   you, Luiz for your first contributions in [24]Perl.

   Thank you, Ryan Thompson for the contributions in [25]Perl and
   [26]Raku.

   I should also thank, Julien Fiegehenn for the contributions in
   [27]Perl.

   After a long time, I managed to submit the solutions to both tasks in
   [28]Perl.

   Guest contributions picked up once again as we had 47 contributions in
   18 different languages. Thank you all guest contributors.

   I would like to talk about Perl Reviews by our in-house expert, Colin
   Crain. I am not sure about other team members, but every time I
   contribute, I always look forward to what Colin has to say about my
   contributions. It is not that I am lucky all the time but I do get
   mention in the review once in a while. It makes me very happy every
   time I do receive positive review.

   Colin Crain shared some interesting stats about recently done Perl
   Reviews.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

   Please checkout the guest contributions for the [53]Week #163.

   Please find [54]past solutions by respected guests. Please share your
   creative solutions in other languages.

Task 1: Prime Palindrome

Submitted by: [55]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find all prime numbers less than 1000, which are also
   palindromes in base 10. Palindromic numbers are numbers whose digits
   are the same in reverse. For example, 313 is a palindromic prime, but
   337 is not, even though 733 (337 reversed) is also prime.

Task 2: Happy Numbers

Submitted by: [56]Robert DiCicco
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find the first 8 Happy Numbers in base 10. For more
   information, please check out [57]Wikipedia.

   Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of
   the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number
   equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which
   does not include 1.

   Those numbers for which this process end in 1 are happy numbers, while
   those numbers that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

Example

   19 is Happy Number in base 10, as shown:
19 => 1^2 + 9^2
   => 1   + 81
   => 82 => 8^2 + 2^2
         => 64  + 4
         => 68 => 6^2 + 8^2
               => 36  + 64
               => 100 => 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2
                      => 1 + 0 + 0
                      => 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 15th May 2022.
