HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #165.

   Let us all welcome 2 new members, James Marquis and Humberto Massa to
   the Team PWC.

   We had the pleasure to interview latest champion, [24]Matthew Neleigh.
   It was great knowing him.

   I would like to thank Ryan Thompson for suggesting cool tasks for the
   weekly challenge. Thanks Early Bird Club members for helping with task
   reviews.

   Thanks Team PWC for reaching the milestone second time in a row i.e.
   100+ regular contributions. We had 40 contributors in the Week #164.

   The Week #164 seems to be special for guest contributors too. We had 14
   contributors sharing solutions in 17 guest languages.

   Talking about contributions, I only managed to find time for the task
   Prime Palindrome in [25]Perl.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

Submitted by: [42]Ryan J Thompson
     __________________________________________________________________

   Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are not made of pixels, but lines,
   ellipses, and curves, that can be scaled to any size without any loss
   of quality. If you have ever tried to resize a small JPG or PNG, you
   know what I mean by “loss of quality”! What many people do not know
   about SVG files is, they are simply XML files, so they can easily be
   generated programmatically.

   For this task, you may use external library, such as Perl’s [43]SVG
   library, maintained in recent years by our very own Mohammad S Anwar.
   You can instead generate the XML yourself; it’s actually quite simple.
   The source for the example image for Task #2 might be instructive.

   Your task is to accept a series of points and lines in the following
   format, one per line, in arbitrary order:

   Point: x,y

   Line: x1,y1,x2,y2

Example:

53,10
53,10,23,30
23,30

   Then, generate an SVG file plotting all points, and all lines. If done
   correctly, you can view the output .svg file in your browser.

Task 2: Line of Best Fit

Submitted by: [44]Ryan J Thompson
     __________________________________________________________________

   When you have a scatter plot of points, a line of best fit is the line
   that best describes the relationship between the points, and is very
   useful in statistics. Otherwise known as linear regression, here is an
   example of what such a line might look like:

   Hull

   The method most often used is known as the [45]least squares method, as
   it is straightforward and efficient, but you may use any method that
   generates the correct result.

   Calculate the line of best fit for the following 48 points:
333,129  39,189 140,156 292,134 393,52  160,166 362,122  13,193
341,104 320,113 109,177 203,152 343,100 225,110  23,186 282,102
284,98  205,133 297,114 292,126 339,112 327,79  253,136  61,169
128,176 346,72  316,103 124,162  65,181 159,137 212,116 337,86
215,136 153,137 390,104 100,180  76,188  77,181  69,195  92,186
275,96  250,147  34,174 213,134 186,129 189,154 361,82  363,89

   Using your rudimentary graphing engine from Task #1, graph all points,
   as well as the line of best fit.
