HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to Week #171 of the weekly challenge.

   Let us all welcome another experienced Perl hacker from France,
   [24]Philippe Bricout. You should definitely checkout his [25]Perl
   solution.

   Welcome back, Mark Senn and thanks for your contribution in [26]Raku.

   Welcome back Cristina Heredia and thank you for your contributions in
   [27]Perl and [28]Python.

   E. Choroba shared [29]link about his discussion he initiated on
   PerlMonks. It is worth taking a look, plenty of new ideas shared.

   Thank you, Stephen G Lynn for sharing his first [30]blog post.

   At last, I found the time to take part in the weekly challenge and
   shared solutions in [31]Perl, [32]Raku and [33]Python.

   With regard to the 1000 days celebration update, I have reached out to
   the recently declared champions i.e. Alexander Pankoff, Robert DiCicco,
   Eric Cheung, Matthew Neleigh and Robert Ransbottom. It is likely I am
   going to add one more champion to the list, to be declared next week. I
   will give them couple of weeks to respond to my email. And then the
   final list would be prepared.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Abundant Number

Submitted by: [50]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 20 Abundant Odd Numbers.

   According to [51]wikipedia,

     A number n for which the sum of divisors σ(n) > 2n, or,
     equivalently, the sum of proper divisors (or aliquot sum) s(n) > n.

   For example, 945 is the first Abundant Odd Number.
Sum of divisors:
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 15 + 21 + 27 + 35 + 45 + 63 + 105 + 135 + 189 + 315 = 975

Task 2: First-class Function

Submitted by: [52]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Create sub compose($f, $g) which takes in two parameters $f and $g as
   subroutine refs and returns subroutine ref i.e. compose($f, $g)->($x) =
   $f->($g->($x))

   e.g.
$f = (one or more parameters function)
$g = (one or more parameters function)

$h = compose($f, $g)
$f->($g->($x,$y, ..)) == $h->($x, $y, ..) for any $x, $y, ...
