HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to Week #178 of the weekly challenge.

   We have two new members joining the Team PWC last week i.e.
   [24]AhmetEmre and [25]Aut0exec. Thank you AhmetEmre for solutions in
   [26]BQN and Aut0exec for solution in [27]Perl.

   Please checkout the interview with our latest champion [28]Marton
   Polgar.

   The two weekly newsletters, one for [29]Perl and another for [30]Raku
   regularly feature the weekly challenge. I am gratefull to both Gabor
   Szabo and Elizabeth Mattijsen for giving us space every week.

   Few days ago, brain d foy, contacted me with the offer of 50 coupons
   for his latest creation, [31]Learning Perl Exercises. I have decided to
   gift one token every week to one lucky member of Team PWC.

   So the Token #1 is given to Cheok-Yin Fung. I will share the details
   with you separately in an email, congratulations.

   Laurent Rosenfeld, thank you for sharing the collection of guest
   contributions, 25 solutions in 18 different languages.

   Altogether we received 72 solutions by 14 contributors.

   Happy to share my solutions in [32]Perl, [33]Raku, [34]Python, [35]Java
   and [36]Swift.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesnâ€™t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Quater-imaginary Base

Submitted by: [56]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to convert a given number (base 10) to quater-imaginary
   base number and vice-versa. For more informations, please checkout
   [57]wiki page.

   For example,
$number_base_10 = 4
$number_quater_imaginary_base = 10300

Task 2: Business Date

Submitted by: [58]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given $timestamp (date with time) and $duration in hours.

   Write a script to find the time that occurs $duration business hours
   after $timestamp. For the sake of this task, let us assume the working
   hours is 9am to 6pm, Monday to Friday. Please ignore timezone too.

   For example,
Suppose the given timestamp is 2022-08-01 10:30 and the duration is 4 hours.
Then the next business date would be 2022-08-01 14:30.

Similar if the given timestamp is 2022-08-01 17:00 and the duration is 3.5 hours
.
Then the next business date would be 2022-08-02 11:30.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 21st August
   2022.
