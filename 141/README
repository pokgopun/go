   We are getting closer to the 1000 days of The Weekly Challenge. I would
   like to thank each and every sponsor of the FREE T-shirt campaign.
   Please do check out the [24]blog post for up to date information about
   the campaign.

   We have a new member in the Team PWC, David Santiago. He is a Raku fan.

   Welcome back Mano Chandar after a long break. You last participated in
   the Week 73 as per our records.

   Welcome back Alexander Pankoff. Last time you participated in the
   weekly challenge was in the Week 100.

   The next few days would be devoted to the preparation of Advent
   Calendar of The Weekly Challenge. It would be our 3rd in a row. Thanks
   to all the contributors. If you want any of your blog post to be part
   of Advent Calendar then please do let me know.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Number Divisors

Submitted by: [39]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find lowest 10 positive integers having exactly 8
   divisors.

Example

24 is the first such number having exactly 8 divisors.
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24.

TASK #2 › Like Numbers

Submitted by: [40]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given positive integers, $m and $n.

   Write a script to find total count of integers created using the digits
   of $m which is also divisible by $n.

   Repeating of digits are not allowed. Order/Sequence of digits can’t be
   altered. You are only allowed to use (n-1) digits at the most. For
   example, 432 is not acceptable integer created using the digits of
   1234. Also for 1234, you can only have integers having no more than
   three digits.

Example 1:

Input: $m = 1234, $n = 2
Output: 9

Possible integers created using the digits of 1234 are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34, 123, 124, 134 and 234.

There are 9 integers divisible by 2 such as:
2, 4, 12, 14, 24, 34, 124, 134 and 234.

Example 2:

Input: $m = 768, $n = 4
Output: 3

Possible integers created using the digits of 768 are:
7, 6, 8, 76, 78 and 68.

There are 3 integers divisible by 4 such as:
8, 76 and 68.
