HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to the Week #150, we reached another milestone, thanks to the
   support and dedication of Team PWC.

   I would like to mention one of the highlights of the weekly challenge
   is the quality blogs shared by the team members. For the Perl Weekly
   newsletter, I have to go through every single blog every week and I can
   tell you it is gem of collections. There are so much to learn from each
   one of them. I appreciate the amount of time each member spend on these
   quality blogs. As of today, we have received 2234 blogs showing the
   power of Perl and Raku in general. I generally bookmark my favourite
   blogs as I go through the list. I noticed the list is growing very
   fast. I have to find time to go through and collect all the gems from
   each one. There are some blogs that only have technical values but also
   great source of english literature, at least to me.

   I have been thinking of creating collection of Abigail regex magic for
   my own knowledge. Unfortunately lack of time is not helping the cause.
   I am sure, others would benefit from it too. Similarly there are plent
   of Raku expert in the team sharing the magical features. It would be
   nice to have the collection of Raku magics. I want to do so much but I
   find no time right now unfortunately. One day, may be, I will learn how
   to prioritise work and be more organised.

   In two months time, we would celebrate 3 years of weekly challenge. It
   is hard to believe we came so far and still going stronger every day. I
   would like to thank each one of you for being there every week.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

TASK #1 › Fibonacci Words

Submitted by: [40]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given two strings having same number of digits, $a and $b.

   Write a script to generate Fibonacci Words by concatenation of the
   previous two strings. Finally print 51st digit of the first term having
   at least 51 digits.

Example:

    Input: $a = '1234' $b = '5678'
    Output: 7

    Fibonacci Words:

    '1234'
    '5678'
    '12345678'
    '567812345678'
    '12345678567812345678'
    '56781234567812345678567812345678'
    '1234567856781234567856781234567812345678567812345678'

    The 51st digit in the first term having at least 51 digits '1234567856781234
567856781234567812345678567812345678' is 7.

TASK #2 › Square-free Integer

Submitted by: [41]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate all square-free integers <= 500.

     In mathematics, a square-free integer (or squarefree integer) is an
     integer which is divisible by no perfect square other than 1. That
     is, its prime factorization has exactly one factor for each prime
     that appears in it. For example, 10 = 2 ⋅ 5 is square-free, but 18 =
     2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3 is not, because 18 is divisible by 9 = 3**2.

Example

The smallest positive square-free integers are
    1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, ...
     __________________________________________________________________

   Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 6th February
   2022.
