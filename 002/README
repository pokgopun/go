Perl Weekly Challenge - 002

   Monday, Apr 1, 2019| Tags: Perl, Raku

   It is already time for the second challenge of “Perl Weekly Challenge”
   event. We have had very positive response so far. We will soon share
   the review of first challenge. You can send us your solutions by
   replying the same email that drops the weekly challenge to your inbox.
   If you are active on twitter then you can DM @PerlWChallenge as well.
   Or if you have GitHub profile then you can even submit your solutions
   as PR to the [14]repository. A gentle reminder, please don’t try to
   golf your solution. We are looking for unique way to solve the problem.
   Also please mention any prereqs to execute the solution i.e. version of
   Perl or Raku. Please add meaningful comment to your code, in case
   anyone (most likely me) reading your code. Avoid using external library
   as much as possible. Try to get the solution straight out of the
   language. We encourage you to blog about your solution, focus on how
   you achieve the result. If you do blog then please share with us.

   Our aim is to engage the Perl community in sharing knowledge. You may
   find some challenge too simple but you can try to solve it in a way no
   one ever thought of before and that would be your moment of pride. We
   try to keep the challenge simple so that more and more people can
   participate and learn from others. At the end of the challenge,
   solutions from all members would be pushed to the github
   [15]repository.

   Last but not the least if you have any suggestions for future
   challenges then please do share with us. Good luck and have fun.

Challenge #1

     Write a script or one-liner to remove leading zeros from positive
     numbers.

Challenge #2

     Write a script that can convert integers to and from a base35
     representation, using the characters 0-9 and A-Y. Dave Jacoby came
     up with nice description about [16]base35, in case you needed some
     background.

   Last date to submit the solution 6 pm (UK Time) Sunday 7th April 2019.

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

   If you have any suggestions or ideas then please do share with us.
