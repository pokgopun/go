HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to yet another fun weekly challenge.

   We had the pleasure to interview our latest champion, [24]Eric Cheung.

   There was another surprise, pleasant one, we had last week. Our ex-Perl
   Reviewer, Ryan J Thompson, got in touch with us. It is always a
   pleasure to hear you, Ryan and thanks for proposing interesting tasks
   for the Week 161.

   Last week, two new guest languages, Elixir and YaBasic introduced to
   the Team PWC, thanks to [25]Maxim Kolodyazhny and [26]Bruce Gray,
   respectively.

   After a long time, we had 15 contributors to the guest languages.
   Although we couldn’t even reach the half way mark, still it is
   promising.

   Welcome back, Mohammad Meraj Zia, after the break and sharing [27]Java
   solution.

   Welcome back, Olivier Delouya and thanks for sharing [28]Perl solution
   after the break.

   Welcome back, Andinus, after the break and thanks for your
   contributions in [29]Raku and [30]blog post.

   Last but not least, I would like to thank Paulo Custodio for solving
   past challenges. Thanks for your support and encouragements.

   I also managed to contribute in [31]Perl and [32]Raku this week.

   As far as regular contributions, we back again with the force. We had
   114 contributions this week. Last time we had more contributions (116)
   than this was in the Week 120.

   There has been delay in getting the T-shirt design for the 1000 days
   celebration. In the meantime, we got 3 more champions declared. I would
   invite the new additions to be part of the celebration. As of today, I
   have 32 confirmations. With 3 more, it would be 35 confirmations
   hopefully. I will keep you informed. Sorry for the delay.

   Good luck with the challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

GUESTS

   Please checkout the guest contributions for the [51]Week #160.

   Please find [52]past solutions by respected guests. Please share your
   creative solutions in other languages.

Task 1: Abecedarian Words

Submitted by: [53]Ryan J Thompson
     __________________________________________________________________

   An abecedarian word is a word whose letters are arranged in
   alphabetical order. For example, “knotty” is an abecedarian word, but
   “knots” is not. Output or return a list of all abecedarian words in the
   [54]dictionary, sorted in decreasing order of length.

   Optionally, using only abecedarian words, leave a short comment in your
   code to make your reviewer smile.

Task 2: Pangrams

Submitted by: [55]Ryan J Thompson
     __________________________________________________________________

   A pangram is a sentence or phrase that uses every letter in the English
   alphabet at least once. For example, perhaps the most well known
   pangram is:
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

   Using the provided [56]dictionary, so that you don’t need to include
   individual copy, generate at least one pangram.

   Your pangram does not have to be a syntactically valid English sentence
   (doing so would require far more work, and a dictionary of nouns,
   verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions). Also note that repeated
   letters, and even repeated words, are permitted.

BONUS: Constrain or optimize for something interesting (completely up to
you), such as:

Shortest possible pangram (difficult)
Pangram which contains only abecedarian words (see challenge 1)
Pangram such that each word "solves" exactly one new letter. For example, such a
 pangram might begin with (newly solved letters in bold):
    a ah hi hid die ice tea ...
    What is the longest possible pangram generated with this method? (All soluti
ons will contain 26 words, so focus on the letter count.)
Pangrams that have the weirdest (PG-13) Google image search results
Anything interesting goes!
