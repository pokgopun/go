   Welcome to a yet another fun Week #170.

   We have new member Dario Mazzeo, an experienced Perl hacker, joining
   the Team PWC.

   Congratulation everyone for reaching the target of 100+ contributions
   once again.

   Even the guest contributions is becoming popular among the team
   members.

   Once again, I couldn’t participate in the weekly challenge. Hay Fever
   has troubled me a lot. Feeling little better today. I am planning to
   get back to YouTube live coding. Please wish me luck.

   Not sure, if you know this, we have father-son duo in the team and they
   are Robert DiCicco and Michael DiCicco.

   Keep sharing knowledge and spread the word among friends.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Primorial Numbers

Submitted by: [43]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 10 Primorial Numbers.

     Primorial numbers are those formed by multiplying successive prime
     numbers.

   For example,
P(0) = 1    (1)
P(1) = 2    (1x2)
P(2) = 6    (1x2×3)
P(3) = 30   (1x2×3×5)
P(4) = 210  (1x2×3×5×7)

Task 2: Kronecker Product

Submitted by: [44]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given 2 matrices.

   Write a script to implement Kronecker Product on the given 2 matrices.

   For more information, please refer [45]wikipedia page.

   For example,
A = [ 1 2 ]
    [ 3 4 ]

B = [ 5 6 ]
    [ 7 8 ]

A x B = [ 1 x [ 5 6 ]   2 x [ 5 6 ] ]
        [     [ 7 8 ]       [ 7 8 ] ]
        [ 3 x [ 5 6 ]   4 x [ 5 6 ] ]
        [     [ 7 8 ]       [ 7 8 ] ]

      = [ 1x5 1x6 2x5 2x6 ]
        [ 1x7 1x8 2x7 2x8 ]
        [ 3x5 3x6 4x5 4x6 ]
        [ 3x7 3x8 4x7 4x8 ]

      = [  5  6 10 12 ]
        [  7  8 14 16 ]
        [ 15 18 20 24 ]
        [ 21 24 28 32 ]
