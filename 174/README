HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to Week #174 of the weekly challenge.

   I nominate, [24]Roger Bell_West for the signed copy of [25]Learning
   Perl, 8th edition by brian d foy. This is the last copy we had, so a
   big Thank You to brian d foy for the generous offer.

   Laurent Rosenfeld is on mission of some kind as he shared the maximum
   guest solutions i.e. 27. He also introduced a new guest language, Dc.
   Not only he shared solutions in [26]Dc but also wrote a dedicated
   [27]blog post sharing the background of the new language. He is
   currently ranked #6 in the Guest Leaders Board and ranked #1 in the
   Team Leaders Board.

   I would like mention two members of Team PWC i.e. [28]Athanasius and
   [29]E. Choroba for the contributions week after week consistently. It
   is not just solutions but quality solutions. Don’t believe me? Take a
   look at [30]Reviews by Colin Crain.

   As I understand, holiday season is going on, some of the regular team
   members also taking a well deserved break. I noticed this when [31]Luca
   Ferrari suddenly disappeared from the scene. Luckily he is back again
   wit his [32]Raku and [33]PostgreSQL. He is a regular blogger too, so we
   had [34]blog post as well.

   Roger Bell_West is on holiday too but being a member of Early Bird Club
   he had access to the future tasks in advance. Therfore we had his
   contributions in [35]Perl and [36]Raku. He is a regular guest
   contributors as well, so we had varieties of solutions in
   [37]JavaScript, [38]Kotlin, [39]Lua, [40]Postscript, [41]Python,
   [42]Ruby and [43]Rust. We had the bonus on top of that, a [44]blog
   post. No wonder, he is ranked #2 in the Team Leaders and Guest Leaders.

   In Week #172, I shared solutions to both tasks in Perl and Raku. It was
   great a feeling. Now in the Week #173, I repeated the same, solved both
   tasks in [45]Perl and [46]Raku. Also like last time, I shared solutions
   in [47]Python. This time, I even had time to do both tasks in [48]Java
   and just one in [49]Swift.

   Atlast, I have the final list of champions for the 1000 days
   celebration. The latest champion PokGoPun has shared the details. So
   now we have altogether 39 champions. It is time to place the order of
   specially designed T-shirt. The credit goes to Lance Wicks for the
   design.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

GUESTS

   Please find [63]past solutions by respected guests. Please share your
   creative solutions in other languages.

Task 1: Disarium Numbers

Submitted by: [64]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 19 Disarium Numbers.

     A disarium number is an integer where the sum of each digit raised
     to the power of its position in the number, is equal to the number.

   For example,
518 is a disarium number as (5 ** 1) + (1 ** 2) + (8 ** 3) => 5 + 1 + 512 => 518

Task 2: Permutation Ranking

Submitted by: [65]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a list of integers with no duplicates, e.g. [0, 1, 2].

   Write two functions, permutation2rank() which will take the list and
   determine its rank (starting at 0) in the set of possible permutations
   arranged in lexicographic order, and rank2permutation() which will take
   the list and a rank number and produce just that permutation.

   Please checkout this [66]post for more informations and algorithm.

   Given the list [0, 1, 2] the ordered permutations are:
0: [0, 1, 2]
1: [0, 2, 1]
2: [1, 0, 2]
3: [1, 2, 0]
4: [2, 0, 1]
5: [2, 1, 0]

   and therefore:
permutation2rank([1, 0, 2]) = 2

rank2permutation([0, 1, 2], 1) = [0, 2, 1]
