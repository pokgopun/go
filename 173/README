HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to Week #173 of the weekly challenge.

   I nominate, [24]Ryan Thompson for the signed copy of [25]Learning Perl,
   8th edition by brian d foy. Next week, we are going to have one more
   nomination.

   After a very long time, I finally managed to find time for both tasks
   in [26]Perl, [27]Raku and [28]Python. There is still something that I
   have been looking forward to do i.e. YouTube Video live coding. You can
   watch my past videos in the dedicated [29]YouTube Channel.

   As we declared PokGoPun last week, champion of the weekly challenge, I
   have sent an email to him requesting his details. Hopefully we will
   have altogether 39 champions, assuming we get the confirmation from
   PokGoPun soon. The total number T-shirts to be ordered is going to be
   40.

   Good luck for the next challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Esthetic Number

Submitted by: [45]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a positive integer, $n.

   Write a script to find out if the given number is Esthetic Number.

     An esthetic number is a positive integer where every adjacent digit
     differs from its neighbour by 1.

   For example,
5456 is an esthetic number as |5 - 4| = |4 - 5| = |5 - 6| = 1
120 is not an esthetic numner as |1 - 2| != |2 - 0| != 1

Task 2: Sylvester’s sequence

Submitted by: [46]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 10 members of Sylvester's sequence.
   For more informations, please refer to the [47]wikipedia page.
