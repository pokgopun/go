HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Welcome to Week #176 of the weekly challenge.

   Today is the first Monday of the month and time to declare our next
   champion. I declare, Marton Polgar, an expert in Raku as the next
   champion. As of today, he has contributed 46 solutions in Raku.

   Laurent Rosenfeld, thank you for the maximum guest contributions, 20
   solutions in 17 different languages.

   Adam Russell shared solution to the task Last Sunday in Fortran for the
   first time with us. Not only that he also wrote a dedicated [24]blog
   post. Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

   Once again, I shared solutions in [25]Perl, [26]Raku, [27]Python,
   [28]Java and [29]Swift.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesnâ€™t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

Task 1: Permuted Multiples

Submitted by: [47]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find the smallest integer x such that x, 2x, 3x, 4x,
   5x and 6x are permuted multiples of each other.

   For example, the integers 125874 and 251748 are permutated multiples of
   each other as
251784 = 2 x 125874

and also both have the same digits but in different order.

Output

142857

Task 2: Reversible Numbers

Submitted by: [48]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to find out all Reversible Numbers below 100.

     A number is said to be a reversible if sum of the number and its
     reverse had only odd digits.

   For example,
36 is reversible number as 36 + 63 = 99 i.e. all digits are odd.
17 is not reversible as 17 + 71 = 88, none of the digits are odd.

Output

10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 27,
30, 32, 34, 36, 41, 43, 45, 50, 52,
54, 61, 63, 70, 72, 81, 90
     __________________________________________________________________

   Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 7th August
   2022.
