HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Before I forget, please let me share the [24]interview with last month
   champion, Paulo Custodio. It is always great pleasure to know about
   weekly champion.

   As you all know, the season of Advent Calendar is coming soon.
   Continuing the tradition, I would like to get Advent Calendar 2021 up
   and running. This year, however, I would like to invite Team PWC to
   suggest one of their blog for the Advent Calendar. In total, I am
   looking for 24 blog posts. Ideally one blog per member. For reference,
   please take a look at past years advent calendars [25]2020 and
   [26]2019.

   I am looking forward to another milestone i.e. completing 1000 days of
   weekly challenge. For this I have designed the T-shirt to celebrate the
   milestone.

   PWC T-Shirt

   Ideally I wanted to gift the T-shirt to all the champions of the weekly
   challenge. But there are couple of things holding me back. First,
   collecting postal address of all champions and second the financial
   aspects of procuring T-shirts and delivering. For record, as of today,
   we have [27]51 Champions. If possible gift the same to Top 10 guest
   contributors also. Finding the sponsor is never my cup of tea as you
   all know. So I am not having high hopes, to be honest.

   Last but not least, let us welcome two new members to Team PWC, Kaushik
   Tunuguntla and Jake.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.

NEW MEMBERS
     __________________________________________________________________

Jake, Perl enthusiasts.

     I’m new to perl and want to learn.

Kaushik Tunuguntla, an experienced Perl Hacker.

     I have about 6 years of experience as a software developer and I
     primarily worked on perl during this time. I came across Gabor’s
     posts related to perl in the early years googling for perl related
     stuff and subscribed to his weekly newsletter. He has blogged on all
     aspects of perl I think. I haven’t followed perl weekly challenge
     closely till now but it’s better late than never, so let me jump in
     and join the party.

   Please find out [37]How to contribute?, if you have any doubts.

   Please try the excellent tool [38]EZPWC created by respected member
   Saif Ahmed of Team PWC.

GUESTS
     __________________________________________________________________

   Please checkout the guest contributions for the [39]Week #138.

   Please find [40]past solutions by respected guests. Please share your
   creative solutions in other languages.

TASK #1 › JortSort

Submitted by: [41]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   You are given a list of numbers.

   Write a script to implement JortSort. It should return true/false
   depending if the given list of numbers are already sorted.

Example 1:

Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
Output: 1

Since the array is sorted, it prints 1.

Example 2:

Input: @n = (1,3,2,4,5)
Output: 0

Since the array is NOT sorted, it prints 0.

TASK #2 › Long Primes

Submitted by: [42]Mohammad S Anwar
     __________________________________________________________________

   Write a script to generate first 5 Long Primes.

     A prime number (p) is called Long Prime if (1/p) has an infinite
     decimal expansion repeating every (p-1) digits.

Example

7 is a long prime since 1/7 = 0.142857142857...
The repeating part (142857) size is 6 i.e. one less than the prime number 7.

Also 17 is a long prime since 1/17 = 0.05882352941176470588235294117647...
The repeating part (0588235294117647) size is 16 i.e. one less than the prime nu
mber 17.

Another example, 2 is not a long prime as 1/2 = 0.5.
There is no repeating part in this case.

   2021.
