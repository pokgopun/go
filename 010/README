Perl Weekly Challenge - 010

   Monday, May 27, 2019| Tags: Perl, Raku

   I came to know about one secret player of Perl Weekly Challenge just
   few days ago. Any guesses? He is the Damian Conway. He doesn’t need any
   introduction. My first encounter with him was when I bought his book
   Perl Best Practices. I have been a big fan of him since then. Checkout
   his [14]blog. I would also like to mention another newly joined member
   Yozen Hernandez. He blogged first time ever that too about his solution
   to the Perl Weekly Challenge. In his [15]blog he wrote something very
   nice and sweet at the end.

     I look forward to doing more of these as not only do they seem like
     a fun way to flex my Perl and problem-solving skills, but I find
     immense value in reading other people’s solutions. It’s often the
     case that I find some incredibly creative way of solving the
     problem, and some solutions are so unique that I learn so much more
     about this language I thought I understood.

   Response like this gives the energy to do better every week.
