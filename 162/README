HEADLINES
     __________________________________________________________________

   Time flies by so fast, it is unbelievable, we are now in the Week #162.

   Let us all welcome new member, Rick Bychowski, from California and
   thank you for your first contributions in [24]Raku.

   We also had, Ryan Thompson, back in action. What a pleasant surprise.
   Not only he shared solutions in [25]Perl but also shared blogs for
   [26]Task #1 and [27]Task #2. Those who don’t know, Ryan Thompson, he
   was our Perl Reviewer for a long time. Please checkout the
   [28]interview with him, if you have time.

   Colin Crain, our current Perl Reviewer, seems very busy this week as he
   could only do [29]Task #1 in Perl. Usually he does both tasks in Perl
   and Raku with two blogs each for the task, every week. Having said, he
   did manage to review Perl solutions for the [30]Week #157. Hopefully he
   would be back in action fully next week.

   Last week was a special one for one more reason, Julien Fiegehenn, a
   very close friend of mine and work colleague (both of us work for
   [31]Oleeo) shared [32]solutions in Perl, after a long time.

   As far as my contribution, I could only do [33]Task #1 in Perl. I could
   have done the same in Raku but didn’t have any energy left. Ramadan is
   taking its toll. One more week left, it is likely next Monday we would
   celebrate Idd in England.

   Last week, we couldn’t reach target but I am very happy to see
   consistent 30+ participants every week. Above all the quality of code
   is very high. Blogging is also on high, last week we had 20 blogs,
   thank you each and every member for the support and encouragement.
   Outside of the weekly challenge zone, I hardly see anyone blog about
   Perl and I am telling this being co-editor of Perl Weekly newsletter.
   So well done Team PWC for keeping the flame alive.

   I just noticed my rank in the Leader Board slipped by 2 positions to
   17th. I would blame two fellow members, Paulo Custodio and Duncan C.
   White for being consistent contributors. I really have to push harder
   now to maintain my position.

   For those, who don’t know, we have Early Bird Club, where members get
   first peek of the upcoming challenges. If you are interested to join
   the club then please send me one line message to
   perlweeklychallenge@yahoo.com.

   Also I would like to request fellow members to suggest fun and
   interesting challenges if you know any. It would be a big help.

   Good luck for this week challenge.

SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2022. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2022. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
