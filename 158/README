SPONSOR
     __________________________________________________________________

   Our solo sponsor Pete Sergeant has been a great support to keep us
   motivated. We are lucky that he agreed to continue the journey with us
   in the year 2021. I would like to personally thank Pete and his entire
   team for their generosity. It would be great if we could add few more
   to sponsor the prize money so that we could go back and declare weekly
   champions as we have done in the past. I hope and wish this will become
   possible in 2021. The amount doesn’t have to be huge. However, it would
   be nice to show off bunch of supporters. If an organisation comes
   forward and supports us then that would be the ultimate achievement.
